Overview

A 3D "shooting" game

Requirements

  - It will be done in the 3D view
  - The viewport/playing area will be in portrait orientation
  - Research the dimensions and aspect ratios of mobile devices to help
  - Rather than a player character, you will spawn a random number of spheres into the play area; every time you play, the number of spheres will be different each time the game is played or restarted
  - There will be boundaries that match the location of the top, bottom, left, and right edges of the viewport
  - These boundaries are invisible
  - The spheres will bounce against each other and the boundaries; they will also float
  - When you click or tap on a sphere, it will disappear
  - When a sphere disappears, it will leave behind a brief spray of particles, like dust or sparkles
  - When a sphere disappears it makes a sound
  - When all of the spheres are gone, you display the number of spheres that disappeared; you also ask if the player wants to go again and provide a button to restart the game

Optionally:
  - Play with the materials and textures of the spheres
  - Randomize the size and sphere materials/textures
  - Randomize the mass + physic material properties for each sphere
